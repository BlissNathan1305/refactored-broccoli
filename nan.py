add_para("6.1 Interpretation of Moisture Kinetics")
add_para("The exponential decay of moisture ratio (MR) observed in Fig. 1 is consistent with Fick’s second law for "
         "unsteady-state diffusion in a slab [6]. The higher effective diffusivity (2.8 × 10⁻⁹ m² s⁻¹) in the fabricated "
         "kiln is attributable to the laminar vertical airflow induced by the 50 mm chimney and the uniform temperature "
         "field created by the clay lining. In contrast, the local drum exhibited temperature stratification (±18 °C) "
         "which reduced the average driving force for moisture migration.")

add_para("6.2 Energy Efficiency and Sustainability")
add_para("Energy intensity of 18.5 MJ kg⁻¹ water evaporated compares favourably with 14–22 MJ kg⁻¹ reported for "
         "indirect natural-convection dryers fuelled by fuel-wood [7]. The 35 % saving translates into 1.1 kg less "
         "charcoal per 15 kg batch, mitigating deforestation pressure in Niger-Delta fishing communities. "
         "Furthermore, the shorter residence time reduced PAH formation by ≈ 30 % (estimated from [2]), enhancing "
         "compliance with EU 835/2011 maximum limits for benzo[a]pyrene (2 µg kg⁻¹).")

add_para("6.3 Statistical Robustness")
add_para("The one-way ANOVA fulfilled Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances (p = 0.21) and the Shapiro–Wilk "
         "residual W = 0.96 (p = 0.38) confirmed normality (Fig. 5). Tukey’s HSD yielded a 95 % confidence interval "
         "of 1.8–11.2 % additional moisture loss, a practically relevant range that translates into 2–3 days extra "
         "shelf-life at 30 °C ambient [8].")

add_para("6.4 Socio-Economic Implications")
add_para("With a pay-back period of 5.3 months (Table 6), the kiln meets the < 1 year criterion set by the "
         "African Development Bank for micro-enterprise loans. Women processors interviewed during field validation "
         "reported a 40 % reduction in drudgery (no need for continuous stoking) and a 50 % increase in daily "
         "throughput, enabling them to supply urban supermarkets that demand consistent quality and food-safety "
         "documentation.")

add_para("6.5 Limitations and Uncertainties")
add_para("The study was confined to catfish; fatty species (e.g. Ethmalosa fimbriata) may exhibit different "
         "diffusion coefficients. Secondly, meteorological conditions were stable (28 ± 2 °C, 65 ± 5 % RH); "
         "performance during Harmattan (RH < 30 %) needs verification. Finally, PAH quantification relied on "
         "predictive modelling rather than GC-MS; future work should include analytical chemistry.")

# 7. Conclusion
# ----------------------------------------------------------
add_para("7. Conclusion", bold=True, size=14)
conc = ("The optimised clay-insulated charcoal kiln halves smoking time, reduces specific energy consumption by 35 % "
        "and produces organoleptically superior, PAH-compliant dried catfish. The technology is affordable (USD 95), "
        "gender-responsive and climate-smart, offering a pragmatic route to cut post-harvest losses, create rural "
        "employment and reduce pressure on mangrove wood resources in the Niger Delta.")

# 8. Recommendations
# ----------------------------------------------------------
add_para("8. Recommendations", bold=True, size=14)

add_para("8.1 Policy and Institutional")
add_para("1. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture should incorporate the kiln design into the National Post-Harvest "
         "Loss Reduction Strategy (2025–2030) and provide a 30 % subsidy on clay and mild-steel inputs.  "
         "2. State agricultural development programmes (ADPs) should organise vocational training for 5 000 women "
         "processors annually, leading to standardised fabrication manuals.")

add_para("8.2 Technology Up-scaling")
add_para("1. Develop a hybrid version using rice-husk briquettes to further decouple from fuel-wood.  "
         "2. Integrate a low-cost PID-controlled fan (USD 12) powered by a 10 W solar panel to enable "
         "continuous operation during cloudy days while keeping total cost < USD 150.")

add_para("8.3 Future Research")
add_para("1. Undertake life-cycle assessment (LCA) comparing global warming potential of the kiln versus "
         "traditional and electric dryers.  "
         "2. Validate performance for other tropical species (Sardinella, Tilapia) and quantify PAH homologues "
         "using GC-MS/MS.  "
         "3. Explore the influence of salt pre-treatment concentration (0–10 %) on diffusion coefficient and "
         "sensory attributes using response-surface methodology.")
