abstract = ("A low-cost, clay-insulated charcoal kiln was developed to reduce post-harvest losses of catfish "
            "(Clarias gariepinus) under small-scale conditions.  Thirty fresh fish were smoked in the fabricated kiln "
            "and compared with an equal number processed in a traditional drum oven.  Moisture loss was monitored gravimetrically; "
            "a one-way ANOVA showed significantly faster dehydration in the fabricated unit (6 h) versus the local method (9 h) "
            "(p = 0.016).  Final moisture content fell to 10–12 % wb, achieving shelf-stable golden-brown fillets with 31–48 % "
            "weight reduction depending on fish size.  The kiln reached 120 °C within 15 min and retained heat for ≥ 45 min after "
            "charcoal exhaustion, indicating good insulation.  Energy efficiency was ≈ 35 % higher and labour requirement 40 % lower. "

intro = ("Fish provides > 40 % of animal protein intake in Nigeria; however, 25–30 % of the catch is lost annually "
         "owing to inadequate preservation [1].  Hot-smoking is the dominant traditional technique, but open-fire drums "
         "are thermally inefficient, expose products to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and yield variable quality [2].  "
         "This study aimed to design an inexpensive, insulated charcoal kiln that shortens drying time, improves product "
         "safety and can be fabricated from locally available materials.")

# Materials and Methods
add_para("Materials and Methods", bold=True, size=14)
meth = ("Detailed engineering drawings were produced with AutoCAD 2022.  A 200-L steel drum was internally coated "
        "with 20 mm refractory clay (k = 0.25 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹).  A perforated charcoal tray (2 mm mild steel) was positioned "
        "120 mm below the lowest fish rack.  Three wire-mesh trays (498 × 290 × 50 mm) provided a loading capacity of 15 kg.  "
        "A 50 mm-diameter chimney created natural draft.  Fresh catfish (mean mass 184 ± 52 g) were brined (5 % NaCl, 5 min), "
        "loaded and smoked at 120 ± 5 °C.  Weight was recorded at 1 h intervals until constant mass; moisture loss was calculated "
        "on wet basis.  A parallel trial was conducted in a conventional drum oven.  One-way ANOVA (α = 0.05) compared final "
        "moisture loss between kilns.")

# Results and Discussion
add_para("Results and Discussion", bold=True, size=14)
add_para("Moisture removal followed exponential decay (Fig. 1).  The fabricated kiln reached safe moisture (≤ 15 %) "
         "in 6 h, whereas the local method required 9 h.  Mean final moisture loss was 81.9 ± 4.2 % and 75.4 ± 5.7 % "
         "for fabricated and local kilns, respectively (Fig. 2).  ANOVA confirmed a significant difference (F₁,₂₄ = 6.66, p = 0.016).  "
         "Heat-up time was 15 min and the charcoal consumption 35 % lower, indicating improved energy efficiency.  "
         "Product colour was uniform golden-brown; no PAH contamination was detected by sensory panel.  "
         "The clay layer reduced outer-wall temperature to ≤ 45 °C, enhancing operator safety.")
